*   **Enhanced Evaluation Metrics:** The current evaluation is basic, relying on simple heuristics like text length and keyword presence. A more sophisticated evaluation engine could use a separate LLM call to score the generated output based on more nuanced criteria like style, coherence, factual accuracy, and adherence to complex instructions. This would provide a much more reliable signal for the learning and refinement modules.

*   **Proactive Error Recovery in Self-Correction:** When the `OutputAnalyzer` or `PromptReviser` fails (e.g., due to invalid LLM JSON output or an API error), the system currently logs the error and falls back to the last known good prompt. A more advanced system could implement a retry mechanism. For example, if JSON parsing fails, it could resend the request to the LLM with an additional instruction in the meta-prompt like "Error: Your previous response was not valid JSON. Please ensure your output is a single, valid JSON object and nothing else."

*   **Full-Fledged Knowledge Base UI:** The application's `mpla_v2.db` database is a rich source of information, storing every prompt, iteration, and evaluation. A future improvement would be to build a dedicated section in the web UI for browsing this knowledge base. Users could view past sessions, compare the performance of different prompts over time, and gain insights into how the agent has learned and improved.

*   **Configuration Management UI:** Many key settings, such as the meta-prompts used by the `Architect`, `OutputAnalyzer`, and `PromptReviser`, are currently hardcoded in the Python files. A "power user" or administrator section in the UI could allow these meta-prompts to be viewed and edited directly, enabling much faster experimentation and tuning of the agent's core behavior without requiring code changes.

*   **Refined UI for Self-Correction Log:** The current self-correction log is a functional, linear stream of text. This could be significantly improved visually. For instance, each correction iteration could be a collapsible section. The analysis could be presented in a structured table, and the "Prompt Revised" section could show a "diff" view highlighting the exact changes made to the prompt, making the agent's "thought process" even more transparent and understandable.

*   **Production Deployment and Hosting Strategy:** Transitioning from a local development server to a production environment is a critical next step. This involves evaluating and selecting a suitable cloud hosting provider (e.g., AWS, Google Cloud Platform, Vercel, Heroku) based on criteria such as cost, scalability, and ease of management. The process would include containerizing the FastAPI backend and the React frontend using Docker, setting up a robust CI/CD pipeline for automated testing and deployment, and configuring a production-grade database and environment variable management system.

*   **Structured Prompt Input Interface:** The current UI relies on a single text area for the initial prompt, which requires the user to structure their context, objectives, and constraints manually. To improve usability and prompt quality, the interface could be enhanced with dedicated input fields for 'Context', 'Objective', and 'Rules/Constraints'. This would guide the user in providing all necessary information in a structured format. For example, the 'Rules' input could accept specific constraints like "Do not use markdown" or "Output must be in a JSON format," which can then be systematically incorporated into the meta-prompt, leading to more predictable and controllable outputs.

*   **Integration of Advanced LLM Models:** The agent currently utilizes the Gemini 1.5 Flash model, which offers a good balance of performance and cost for rapid iteration. To unlock higher-quality outputs and more sophisticated reasoning, the system should be upgraded to support more powerful models, such as Gemini 2.5 Pro. This would involve updating the `GoogleGeminiDeploymentOrchestrator` to handle the new model API and potentially adding a model selection dropdown to the UI. This would empower users to choose the optimal model for their specific task, balancing the trade-off between speed, cost, and generative quality.
